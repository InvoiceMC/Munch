# üçΩÔ∏è Munch
Munch is an `open-source` SQLite annotation API. This API has great performance and has frequent updates. 

Munch offers many systems to improve your productivity such as offering `Serializers, Custom Types, and SQL Generators`. You can create a fully functional database in **~10 Lines**!

> [!NOTE]
> Munch is currently in the **BETA** stage, we are currently foucused on improving memory usage / performance.
 
## ü§î Why Munch?
Munch is a very optimized API which offers many things at your disposal, which has reduced the amount of code you need to write by about `93.33%` less code!

- Using Default SQLite: `~150 lines`
- Using Munch: `~10 lines`

Munch also offers lots of features you can use such as
- Thread Safe
- Auto Serializers *(Needs to implement `Serializable`)*
- Low Storage Usage
- Low Performance Cost
- User-Friendly

## üéâ Creating Database
Firstly you will need to create your `data class`. This class has to have the `@Table` annotation or the processor wont work. This class will also **HAVE** to be a **data** class.

You will also need to make all the variables **var** since internally we are casting the properties into Mutable thus Munch will not work with **val** values.

Here's an example of creating that data class:
```kt
@Table("TableName") // If the table name isn't set it will default to the data class's name
data class PlayerData(
    @PrimaryKey val id: Int,
    @Column val name: String,
    @Column(constraints = ColumnConstraint.NOTNULL) var level: Int, // This will make the value NOT NULL in the SQLite database
    @Column var isCool: Boolean,
)
```

Then to make a database for it you will need to do this:
```kt
fun main() {
    val clazz = Munch.create(PlayerData::class).process<Int>() // <Int> is the primary key's type, which just helps with auto completion using the connection
    val database = MunchConnection.create(clazz) // This will auto create the database for you if you dont want to create a table and connect to the database you can use `MunchConnection.create()`

    val data = PlayerData(10, "Insavings", true)
    database.addData(clazz, data)
}
```
